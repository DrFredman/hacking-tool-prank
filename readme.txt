THIS IS NOT A REAL HACKING TOOL, BUT A JOKE SCRIPT THAT PRETENDS TO BE A HACKING TOOL!

This script can be used to prank your friends into thinking you are a real hacker. Any email or password used in this script should not have any similarities to the real world, and if there are, it is purely coincidental. I am aware that most text that is printed doesn't really make any sense, but to an unknowing person you will seem to be a hacking genius. 

Also, you can edit the script to include an email of your choosing as an email to "hack" and same with the password. You can do so by commenting out the comments near the beginning of the script (line 11 and 12) and putting your email and password there. SQLHackLib.lib file is required to be in the same folder the script is being ran in (unless you modify it yourself). Run this script on a linux operating system for everything to work as intended. 

TOOLS TO INSTALL BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPT (for ubuntu/debian)
Cmatrix: apt-get install cmatrix
Mate Terminal: apt-get install mate-terminal

Last thing, when the script asjs you for a port number, enter 3306 as that is the default MySQL port number.
